# Probabilistic Fraud Detection: Bayesian Real-Time Transaction Monitoring

**A comprehensive data science project applying advanced probability theory to detect fraudulent financial transactions.**

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete probabilistic framework for fraud detection, combining Bayesian inference, Markov processes, and Monte Carlo simulation to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions about transaction monitoring and risk assessment.

The notebook demonstrates how to build production-ready fraud detection systems using rigorous probability theory, with practical applications in real-time transaction monitoring, risk quantification, and cost-sensitive decision-making.

## Probability Methods Applied

- **Bayesian Inference**: Online learning for fraud pattern detection with conjugate priors
- **Hidden Markov Models**: User behavior sequence modeling and state transitions
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Risk quantification and decision threshold optimization
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Unsupervised anomaly detection in transaction patterns
- **Bayesian Decision Theory**: Cost-sensitive fraud classification
- **Stochastic Processes**: Uncertainty quantification in fraud predictions

## Key Features

### Advanced Probabilistic Models
- **Beta-Binomial Conjugate Analysis**: Efficient Bayesian updating for fraud rates
- **HMM State Modeling**: Three-state system (Normal, Suspicious, Fraud)
- **Monte Carlo Risk Assessment**: Financial impact simulation and optimization
- **Ensemble Methods**: Weighted combination of multiple probabilistic approaches

### Real-World Applications
- Real-time fraud scoring with uncertainty quantification
- Cost-sensitive threshold optimization
- Financial impact analysis and ROI calculation
- Segment-specific risk assessment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Recommended: Use conda for C++ compiler support
conda create -n fraud-detection python=3.10
conda activate fraud-detection
conda install gxx  # Fixes PyMC performance warnings

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Project
```bash
jupyter notebook probabilistic_fraud_detection.ipynb
```

**Note**: If you see PyMC/PyTensor warnings about missing C++ compiler, install it via conda:
```bash
conda install gxx
```
This improves performance but is not required for functionality.
